<h1> Hello, I'm <strong>Andy Mayer</strong> – a software developer with a track record of leading the research, design and delivery of new digital services for people struggling with life.</h1>

<p>I've spent the last 12 years as Strategy Director at Yoomee – on a mission to help non-profits innovate like tech startups, using methodologies such as Lean Startup and Agile.</p>

<p>During this time I've gained considerable experience designing for vulnerable users, with users – including young people and people with mental health problems.  
</p>
<p>
I can help you grow teams and implement innovation processes to design and deliver new digital services to make the world a better place. I'm particularly interested in projects with the potential to achieve social impact at scale.
</p>
<p>
In my spare time I volunteer as a chaplain in the local prison and am also helping prisoners learn to code with Code4000.
</p>
<p>
I'm currently helping non-profits understand and harness the latest developments in chatbots and artificial intelligence.
</p>
